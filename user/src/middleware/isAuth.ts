    # What it does:
    =>req is the object representing the incoming HTTP request in Express.

    =>req.headers is an object containing all the headers sent by the client in the HTTP request.

    =>authorization is a special header where clients usually send their authentication credentials, like a token or username/password.

    =>This line tries to read the value of the Authorization header from the incoming request.

    =>The value is assigned to the variable authHeader for further use.

    # Why is it important?
    =>When you use token-based authentication like JWT, the client sends the token inside this header, usually like:
    Authorization: Bearer gferuifheuifheuifgeyugdhvwygd

    #By reading req.headers.authorization, your server can get the token from the request in order to:
    =>Verify the tokenâ€™s validity
    =>Authenticate the user
    =>Give access to protected resources
